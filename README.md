# Soph

The Soph API is a simple project developed as a hobby for study purposes. The
API aims to provide a centralized location for thoughts and quotes from public,
influential and perhaps historic personalities found in all available media.
Such thoughts are organized into topics and in different languages, offering
their source. This allows recording and sharing knowledge on a large scale, in
addition to providing an interface for consumption in other study projects.
